            <h2>Building a community</h2>
            <p>
              Given that one of the foundational aspects of good design is to
              solve problems, it must be recognised that a problem shared is a
              problem halved. This is why coming together and sharing the
              problems which we are trying to solve is a great way to drive our
              community forward.
            </p>
            <p>
              With this in mind, Chris organises and co-hosts
              <strong>

                </a>
              </strong>
              on Meetup.com. In coming together the community has shared how it
              solves problems around: design systems; collaborating with
              developers; getting hired; plus many other topics.
